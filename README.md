## About Me

As a Full Stack developer, I am incredibly driven by the pursuit of knowledge. My passion for continuous learning pushes me to explore various areas beyond development, including Tests, DevOps, Leadership, and UX Design. To ensure that my programs are of top-notch quality, I follow the principles of the Object Calisthenics Pattern and prioritize fluent writing.

## What do you like to do about programming?

- I love to help anyone with logic in any kind of program or language, you can reach me.
